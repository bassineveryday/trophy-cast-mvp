# Missing Components & Quick Fixes Checklist

Generated: 2025-09-27

## Missing Routes/Components

All core routes and components are present and accounted for! ‚úÖ

## Weak Spots / Risks

### üîç Security & Configuration
- [ ] **Hardcoded Supabase Keys**: Keys are visible in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - acceptable for client-side public keys
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: No `process.env` usage detected (good - not supported in Lovable)
- [ ] **Demo Mode Security**: Demo mode is properly isolated and doesn't affect real data

### üîó Data Integration Gaps
- [ ] **Missing API Function**: No `src/features/catches/api.ts` file (mentioned in previous commits)
- [ ] **Incomplete Type Definitions**: Some database operations may need stronger typing
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: No global error boundary components detected

### üì± User Experience
- [ ] **Loading States**: Some components may need better loading indicators
- [ ] **Offline Support**: No service worker or offline capabilities
- [ ] **Performance**: Large bundle size due to comprehensive feature set

### üß™ Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Missing Tests**: No test files detected in project structure
- [ ] **Form Validation**: Some forms may need enhanced validation
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Database inputs should be validated server-side

## Quick Additive Fixes

### üõ† Immediate Improvements (No Risk)

- [ ] **Create Catches API Helper**:
  ```typescript
  // Create: src/features/catches/api.ts
  // Add createCatch, updateCatch, deleteCatch functions
  // Implement idempotency and validation
  ```

- [ ] **Add Global Error Boundary**:
  ```tsx
  // Create: src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  // Wrap App content to catch React errors gracefully
  ```

- [ ] **Enhanced Loading Components**:
  ```tsx
  // Create: src/components/LoadingStates.tsx
  // Skeleton loaders for major data components
  ```

- [ ] **Form Validation Schemas**:
  ```typescript
  // Create: src/lib/validation.ts
  // Zod schemas for all forms and data inputs
  ```

### üéØ Demo Mode Enhancements

- [ ] **Demo Data Seed Script**:
  ```typescript
  // Create: src/demo/seedData.ts
  // Populate demo mode with realistic sample data
  ```

- [ ] **Demo Mode Indicator**:
  ```tsx
  // Create: src/components/DemoModeIndicator.tsx
  // Visual indicator when demo mode is active
  ```

### üìä Data Layer Improvements

- [ ] **Query Optimization**:
  ```typescript
  // Enhance: src/hooks/useCatches.ts
  // Add pagination, filtering, and caching strategies
  ```

- [ ] **Real-time Updates**:
  ```typescript
  // Create: src/lib/realtime.ts
  // Centralized Supabase real-time subscription management
  ```

### üîß Developer Experience

- [ ] **API Response Types**:
  ```typescript
  // Create: src/types/api.ts
  // Standardized API response and error types
  ```

- [ ] **Custom Hooks Documentation**:
  ```markdown
  // Create: docs/HooksAPI.md
  // Document all custom hooks with examples
  ```
