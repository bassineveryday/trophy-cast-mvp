# Welcome to your Lovable project

## üöÄ Bare-Bones Mode

This app is currently running in **bare-bones MVP mode** with minimal routes for core functionality:

- **Home** (`/`) - Welcome screen with quick actions
- **Log Catch** (`/catch-logging`) - Voice-enabled catch logging
- **Leaderboard** (`/leaderboard`) - Tournament standings
- **My Catches** (`/my-catches`) - Personal catch history  
- **Profile** (`/profile`) - User profile management

To restore full functionality, re-add the removed routes and components from the git history.

## üîí Lane Isolation & Security

### What is Lane Isolation?

Trophy Cast uses **lane isolation** to separate production and demo data. Each user has an `is_demo` flag in their profile that determines which "lane" of data they can access:

- **Production Lane** (`is_demo = false`): Real tournament data, real users
- **Demo Lane** (`is_demo = true`): Sandbox data for testing/demos

### Why is the Supabase Anon Key in the Repo?

**This is intentional and safe.** Lovable does not support `VITE_*` environment variables, so the Supabase anon key is hardcoded in:

- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- `scripts/smokeLane.mjs`

**Security is provided by:**
1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies on all tables
2. **Lane-safe views** that auto-filter by `is_demo`
3. **Lane-safe RPCs** that enforce user's lane membership
4. The anon key has no write permissions without RLS checks

Never use `service_role` key in client code.

### Lane-Safe Data Access

All Supabase queries must use lane-safe patterns:

#### ‚úÖ Safe: Use Lane-Safe Views
```typescript
import { supabase } from "@/integrations/supabase/client";

// Automatically filtered by user's is_demo flag
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('v_aoy_standings_demo')
  .select('*')
  .order('aoy_rank');
```

#### ‚úÖ Safe: Use Lane-Safe RPCs
```typescript
// RPC auto-filters by user's lane and club
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('aoy_for_current_user_demo');
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('event_points_for_current_user_demo', {
  p_event_id: eventId
});
```

#### ‚ùå Unsafe: Direct Table Queries
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS - may leak cross-lane data!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('aoy_standings')  // ‚ùå No auto-filtering
  .select('*');
```

### Available Lane-Safe Artifacts

#### Views (SECURITY INVOKER)
- `v_aoy_standings_demo` - AOY standings filtered by user's lane
  - Columns: `member_id`, `member_name`, `season_year`, `total_aoy_points`, `aoy_rank`, `boater_status`, `club_id`
  
- `v_event_points_demo` - Event points from tournament results
  - Columns: `event_id`, `member_id`, `member_name`, `place`, `aoy_points`, `season`

#### RPCs (SECURITY DEFINER)
- `aoy_for_current_user_demo(p_limit int)` - AOY for user's club
  - Returns: Same columns as `v_aoy_standings_demo`
  - Auto-filters by user's `is_demo` and `club_id`
  
- `event_points_for_current_user_demo(p_event_id uuid, p_limit int)` - Event points for user's club
  - Returns: `event_id`, `member_id`, `member_name`, `place`, `aoy_points`, `season`, `club_id`
  - Optional `p_event_id` filter

#### Helper Functions
- `get_user_is_demo()` - Returns current user's `is_demo` flag (used internally by RPCs)

### Running Lane Smoke Tests

Test that lane isolation is working:

```bash
node scripts/smokeLane.mjs
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Query `v_aoy_standings_demo` view
- ‚úÖ Call `aoy_for_current_user_demo` RPC  
- ‚úÖ Call `event_points_for_current_user_demo` RPC (with/without event filter)

Output will show ‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è for each test. Script never fails (exit 0) to avoid breaking CI.

### Seeding Demo Data

To add demo tournament data, use SQL with `is_demo = true`:

```sql
-- Insert demo club
INSERT INTO clubs (id, name, location, is_demo, created_by)
VALUES (
  '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111',
  'Demo Bass Club',
  'Demo Lake, AL',
  true,
  auth.uid()
);

-- Insert demo AOY standing
INSERT INTO aoy_standings (
  member_id, member_name, season_year, 
  total_aoy_points, aoy_rank, boater_status, 
  club_id, is_demo
)
VALUES (
  '22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222',
  'Demo Angler',
  2025,
  1500,
  1,
  'Boater',
  '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111',
  true  -- ‚úÖ Critical: Keeps this in demo lane
);
```

**Important:** Always set `is_demo = true` for demo data and ensure your demo user profile has `is_demo = true`.

### Lane Badge

A visible badge shows the current lane in the app header:
- üü¢ **PRODUCTION** - Real data
- üîµ **DEMO** - Sandbox data

See: `src/components/LaneBadge.tsx`

### For Contributors

When adding new features:

1. ‚úÖ All new tables must include `is_demo boolean` column with RLS policies
2. ‚úÖ Use lane-safe views or RPCs for all data queries
3. ‚úÖ Test both production and demo lanes
4. ‚úÖ Run `node scripts/smokeLane.mjs` before committing
5. ‚ùå Never bypass RLS with `service_role` key in client code

See `.github/pull_request_template.md` for full checklist.
