### 🔒 Lane Isolation Checklist

**Critical:** All PRs that touch data access must verify lane safety.

- [ ] All Supabase reads use lane-safe views (`v_*_demo`) or lane-aware RPCs
- [ ] No direct table queries that bypass lane filtering
- [ ] Any new tables include `is_demo boolean` column with proper RLS policies
- [ ] No `service_role` key used in client code (only `anon` key allowed)
- [ ] If adding/modifying RPCs or views, they use `get_user_is_demo()` or similar lane checks
- [ ] Tested in both DEMO and PRODUCTION lanes (verified lane badge)
- [ ] Ran `node scripts/smokeLane.mjs` and all tests passed

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Tested locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npm run build` passes)
- [ ] Verified responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] Tested with both authenticated and unauthenticated users (if applicable)

### For Reviewers

**Lane Safety Verification:**
1. Check that all data queries use lane-safe patterns
2. Verify RLS policies are in place for new tables
3. Confirm no hardcoded lane assumptions (e.g., `is_demo = true` in app code)
4. Test the PR in both demo and production modes

**Security Verification:**
1. No `service_role` key in client code
2. No sensitive data exposed in logs or errors
3. No SQL injection vulnerabilities in raw queries
4. Proper input validation on all user inputs
